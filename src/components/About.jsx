      {/* My journey into software engineering began with my passion for technology and problem-solving, which I discovered while running my own e-commerce business. Managing an online operation gave me firsthand experience in understanding user needs, structured planning, and efficient workflows that naturally align with software development. This led me to App Academy, where I honed my expertise in full-stack development using JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, Express, and SQL-based databases.

      <br />
      I have hands-on experience with PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and SQLAlchemy for database management, as well as AWS S3 for cloud-based file storage. I’m also proficient in Git for version control, ensuring clean and collaborative codebases. Through projects like Screenshare, Homebnb, and Flux, I’ve built features like real-time collaboration, user authentication, and advanced search/filter functionalities, refining both my backend and frontend development skills.
      <br />
      <br />
      I thrive in collaborative environments and have applied Agile methodologies like Kanban task management and daily stand-ups to ensure team efficiency. What excites me most is transforming abstract ideas into impactful software, continuously refining solutions, and expanding my expertise in backend architectures and cloud technologies. Looking forward to connecting and contributing to meaningful projects. */}
      Moving to the United States alone at 21 was one of the most defining challenges of my life. It pushed me to adapt, solve problems independently, and develop resilience, skills that naturally align with software engineering. While running my own e-commerce business, I became deeply aware of how technology shapes user experiences. I often noticed websites and applications struggling with smooth interactions and usability. Over time, I realized I didn’t just want to navigate these inefficiencies, I wanted to fix them. That’s what led me to programming: the drive to create seamless, intuitive, and effective solutions.
      <br /><br />
      I enjoy solving problems, whether it's optimizing a user experience, structuring an application for efficiency, or even analyzing plot inconsistencies in movies just for fun. When planning a project, I instinctively think about what might go wrong first. Identifying potential roadblocks early allows me to eliminate them before they become issues, ensuring a smoother and more reliable outcome.
      <br /><br />
      At App Academy, I developed expertise in full-stack development, working with JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, Express, and SQL-based databases such as PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and SQLAlchemy. I also have experience with AWS S3 for cloud-based file storage and Git for version control, ensuring clean and collaborative codebases. Working in Agile environments, I have applied Kanban task management and daily stand-ups with my team to maintain efficiency and iterate on features quickly. I also collaborated closely with peers through pair programming, improving code quality and knowledge sharing. Through projects like Screenshare, HomeBnB, and Flux, I have built applications featuring real-time collaboration, authentication, and custom search and filtering features, refining both my backend and frontend development skills.
      <br /><br />
      Coming from a different cultural background has shaped the way I approach teamwork and problem-solving. I bring adaptability, creativity, and a strong sense of structure to my work, allowing me to design solutions that cater to diverse users. I am excited about building impactful software, continuously refining ideas, and working with others to create seamless, high-quality applications.
