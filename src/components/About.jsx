      <h2 className="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <p className="about-text">
      My journey into software engineering began with my passion for technology and problem-solving, which I discovered while running my own e-commerce business. Managing an online operation gave me firsthand experience in understanding user needs, structured planning, and efficient workflows that naturally align with software development. This led me to App Academy, where I honed my expertise in full-stack development using JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, Express, and SQL-based databases. 
      <br />
      <br />
      I have hands-on experience with PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and SQLAlchemy for database management, as well as AWS S3 for cloud-based file storage. I’m also proficient in Git for version control, ensuring clean and collaborative codebases. Through projects like Screenshare, Homebnb, and Flux, I’ve built features like real-time collaboration, user authentication, and advanced search/filter functionalities, refining both my backend and frontend development skills.
      <br />
      <br />
      I thrive in collaborative environments and have applied Agile methodologies like Kanban task management and daily stand-ups to ensure team efficiency. What excites me most is transforming abstract ideas into impactful software, continuously refining solutions, and expanding my expertise in backend architectures and cloud technologies. Looking forward to connecting and contributing to meaningful projects.
